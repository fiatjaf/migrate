# Migrate to Nostr

Migrate articles or blog posts to Nostr. A NIP07 browser extension is needed to use the tool.

**For now it works only for Substack**

Visit the website at [migrate-nostr.netlify.app](https://migrate-nostr.netlify.app/)

## Substack

Go on Substack, and generate an export of your posts. Check the guide [here](https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037466012-How-do-I-export-my-posts-).

Unzip the export file and then follow the instructions to upload the `posts.csv` file and the `.html` files inside the `posts/` folder.

_Other blogging platforms will be added later... hopefully..._
